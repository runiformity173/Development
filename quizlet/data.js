let data = `Statistics	the science and art of collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data

Individual	an object described by a set of data

Variable	an attribute that can take different values for different individuals

Categorical Variable	assigns labels that place each individual into a particular group, called a category

Quantitative Variable	takes number values that are quantities - counts or measurements

Distribution	tells us what values the variable takes and how often it takes these values

Frequency Table	shows the number of individuals having each value

Relative Frequency Table	shows the proportion or percent of individuals having each value

Bar Graph	Shows each category as a bar. The heights of the bars show the category frequencies or relative frequencies

Pie Chart	Shows each category as a slice of the "pie." The areas of the slices are proportional to the category frequencies or relative frequencies

Two-Way Table	a table of counts that summarizes data on the relationship between two categorical variables for some group of individuals

Marginal Relative Frequency	gives the percent or proportion of individuals that have a specific value for one categorical variable.

Joint Relative Frequency	gives the percent or proportion of individuals that have a specific value for one categorical variable and a specific value for another categorical variable

Conditional Relative Frequency	gives the percent or proportion of individuals that have a specific value for one categorical variable among individuals who share the same value of another categorical variable (the condition)

Side-By-Side Bar Graph	displays the distribution of a categorical variable for each value of another categorical variable. The bars are grouped together based on the values of one of the categorical variables and placed side by side

Segmented Bar Graph	displays the distribution of a categorical variable as segments of a rectangle, with the area of each segment proportional to the percent of individuals in the corresponding category

Association	present if knowing the value of one variable helps us predict the value of the other

Dotplot	shows each data value as a dot above its location on a number line

Symmetric Distribution	the right and left sides of the graph are approximately mirror images of each other

Skewed distribution	that side is longer than the other side

Stemplot	shows each data value separated into two parts: a stem, which consists of all but the final digit, and a leaf, the final digit. The stems are ordered from lowest to highest and arranged in a vertical column. The leaves are arranged in increasing order out from the appropriate stems.

Histogram	shows each interval of values as a bar. The heights of the bars show the frequencies or relative frequencies of values in each interval.

Mean (x-bar)	the average of all the individual data values

Resistant	a statistical measure that isn't sensitive to extreme values

Median	the midpoint of a distribution, such that about half the observations are smaller and about half are larger

Range	the distance between the minimum value and the maximum value

Standard Deviation	measures the typical distance of the values in a distribution from the mean

Quartiles	divide data sets into fourths, or four equal parts

First Quartile (Q1)	the median of the data values that are to the left of the median in the ordered list

Third Quartile (Q3)	the median of the data values that are to the right of the median in the ordered list

Interquartile Range (IQR)	the distance between the first and third quartiles of a distribution. Q3-Q1

Five-Number Summary	minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum

Boxplot	A visual representation of the five number summary

Percentile	the percent of values in a distribution that are less than the individual's data value

Standardized Score (z-score)	tells us how many standard deviations from the mean the value falls, and in what direction

Density Curve	a curve that is on or above the horizontal axis, and has an area of exactly one underneath it

Mean of a Density Curve	the point at which the curve would balance if made of solid material

Median of a Density Curve	the equal-areas point, the point that divides the area under the curve in half

Normal Distribution	has a symmetric, single-peaked, bell-shaped density curve

Normal curve	the density curve of a normal distribution

The 68-95-99.7 Rule	68% of observations within one standard deviation, 95% within 2, and 99.7% within 3

Standard Normal Distribution	the Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1

Normal Probability Plot	a scatterplot of the ordered pair (data value, expected z-score) for each of the individuals in a quantitative data set. That is, the x-coordinate of each point is the actual data value and the y-coordinate is the expected z-score corresponding to the percentile of that data value in a standard Normal distribution.`;
